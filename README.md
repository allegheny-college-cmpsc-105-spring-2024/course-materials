## <span style="color:green"> Course Description</span>

An introduction to the methods of collecting, exploring, transforming and visualizing data for storytelling. Often participating in team-based and hands-on activities, students learn how to use web platforms and dashboards to acquire, explore and investigate data to generate summarized key data insights using visual techniques. Students also apply open-source programming language to discover patterns in the data, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using graphical representations.  During a weekly laboratory session, students employ cutting-edge software tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

_Prerequisite:_ None

_Distribution Requirements:_ QR, SP.

DR tag rationale: This course will primarily focus on methods of data collection, foundational data analysis of numerical data, and visualizations of such data. Additionally, students will participate in the scientific process during the exploratory data analysis and apply scientific reasoning to analyze and synthesize data.

## <span style="color:green">Learning Outcomes</span>

- Develop hypotheses based on motivating problems and/or observations and identify appropriate data to address hypotheses.
- Identify and describe key elements in different types of data visualizations.
- Use web-based platforms to accurately present data sets through multiple visualizations.
- Use an open-source programming language to compute summary statistics and visualize key patterns in the data.
- Contribute to and present structured, web-based documentation that describes data exploration steps and visualization-based conclusions.

### Additional Outcomes

**Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge
aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world;
apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and
create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an
understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

**Quantitative Reasoning (QR)**: Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand,
investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information
towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate
an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic
representations.

## <span style="color:green">Grading</span>

|Assignment type |Percentage|
|-|--------|
|Labs| 60% |
|Participation| 20% |
|Final Project | 20% |

The instructor may update the grading policy as needed during the term, but any changes will be announced to the class at the time of the change. Grades will be communicated throughout the semester in a grades repository on GitHub.

### Labs

There are 10 labs during the semester focused on achieving the learning outcomes.
The deliverables for labs include documentation in a GitHub repo addressing specific questions
or demonstrating requested calculations, analyses, visualizations, and code snippets. The labs will
be released at least one week before their due dates. Due dates are hard deadlines.

Optionally, two labs can be redone any time before the end of the semester. The new grade will
completely replace the old grade. Students may take these two redos as an extension at their
discretion.

For each lab, grades will be determined 50% through gatorgrade (automatic reporting system),
and 50% by direct evaluation. The direct evaluation is comprised of four checks:

- clean work with few careless errors
- correct Markdown, code, and/or data not already gatorgraded
- correct images given the context of the lab
- correct explanations of concepts in writing

### Participation

Participation is required. Participation will be assessed by completion of in-class Google forms,
class discussions/presentations, and timely lab work. At least ten participation activities will take
place during the semester. Attendance will not be calculated per se, but please notify the instructor
in as timely a manner as possible about any known absences.

### Final Project

The final project will be open ended. Techniques and skills learned throughout the course should be demonstrated in the project in a final presentation (included in the final project grade). The project must be approved by the teaching team in an initial stage. The artifact will be a final, and more detailed blog post, approximately three times the work compared to a lab.

## <span style="color:green">Additional Policies</span>

### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication.
We will use GitHub for submitting assignments. The
[Allegheny College Computer and Information Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) will be the main forum for announcements
and technical discussions about Data Exploration and
departmental activities including TL office hours.

### Health

Please take appropriate precautions if you are sick. This includes staying home if you need to rest and recover. Respect your health and the health of others.

### Absence

Two unexcused absences are allowed, and attendance will not be calculated or graded per se.
Following Allegheny College policy, consecutive absences will be noted. Please inform the instructor
in a timely manner about any known absences or conflicts with the scheduled classes. Graded work
beyond one lab that is missed due to absence cannot be made up except in the case of extreme
extenuating circumstances.

### Honor Code

The Honor Code applies to all work in this course. Recall the pledge:
> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Examples of plagiarism include:

- verbatim copying without citation (no original logic, no original writing)
- copying with single word modifications (no original logic, some original writing)
- paraphrasing or using notes on a source without citation (no original logic)
- asking what someone wrote and rewriting it (no original logic, no original writing)

To claim that work is your own, it is essential to craft the logic and the writing together
without copying or using the logical structure of another source. The honor code holds everyone
to this standard. Non-original work will not be graded.

### Seeking Assistance

There are many ways to get help.

- TLs in class sessions
- Productive peer discussion
- Descriptive Discord messages
- Stack Overflow
- Python Documentation
- TL office hours
- GitHub issue requests
- Instructor office hours

### Statement of Community
